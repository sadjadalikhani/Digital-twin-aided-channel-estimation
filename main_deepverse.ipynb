    "# Digital Twin-Aided Channel Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate channel estimation in **sparse, high-dimensional wireless environments** is crucial for next-generation systems, especially in large-scale MIMO deployments. This work presents a **digital twin (DT)-aided framework** that leverages simulated counterparts of real environments as **priors** to enable **efficient zone-specific, subspace-based channel estimation (CE)**. By focusing on the **dominant channel components** in the angular domain, the subspace-based CE approach drastically reduces feedback overhead while maintaining high estimation accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although DT channels may not perfectly match real measurements, their **coarse-grained subspaces** provide an informative initialization that narrows the search space and accelerates convergence. The framework adopts a **two-step clustering process** on the **Grassmann manifold**, followed by **reinforcement learning (RL)-based calibration** to progressively align DT-derived subspaces with their real-world counterparts. Simulation results show that digital twins not only enable **near-optimal channel estimation performance**, but also enhance **subspace calibration accuracy** through learning, illustrating their potential as a foundation for **adaptive, learnable digital twins** in future wireless systems.\n",

    "The figure illustrates the proposed **zone-specific subspace prediction and calibration framework** for channel estimation using digital twins. The base station (BS) designs **zone-dependent precoders**, enabling UEs to estimate the **projection of real-world channels onto low-dimensional DT-based subspaces**. Zones are defined by **subspace similarity** among users on the Grassmann manifold. This approach minimizes CSI feedback overhead by exploiting **channel sparsity** and **DT-based subspace detection**. To compensate for DT approximation errors, subspaces are iteratively **calibrated via reinforcement learning**, balancing estimation accuracy and overhead.\n",

Specifically, we use the **CARLA-TOWN05** scene as the *real-world* environment and generate its **digital counterpart** by intentionally introducing controlled errors in the signal propagation model.\n",

In contrast, **digital twin UEs** are limited to at most **5 paths**, reflecting an imperfect but computationally efficient approximation of the true environment. This controlled mismatch enables us to systematically study how well the digital twin can serve as a prior for real-world channel estimation and how calibration methods can bridge the gap between the two."

This prior information enables **efficient zone-specific pilot generation** at the base station and improved channel estimation. Instead of using all DFT beams, we utilize the DT prior to select the **top-(k)** DFT vectors as pilots.
